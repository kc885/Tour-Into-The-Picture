        Implementation of the exemplar based inpainting algorithm described in
        "Object Removal by Exemplar-Based Inpainting", A. Criminisi et. al. 
            
        Changes made by the author with respect to the original paper:
            - the template match error is calculated based on larger patch sizes than those
              used to infill. The reason behind this is to compare a larger portion of source
              and target regions and thus to avoid visual artefacts.
      
            - the search for the best matching spot of the patch position to be inpainted
              is accelerated by TemplateMatchCandidates.

        Please note edge cases (i.e regions on the image border) are crudely handled by simply 
        discarding them.
